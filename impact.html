              <h3>Global warming is already underway with consequences that must be faced today as well as tomorrow. Evidence of changes to the Earth's physical, chemical and biological processes is now evident on every continent.</h3>

              <p>To fully appreciate the urgency of climate change, it's important to understand the ways it affects society and the natural environment. Sea levels are rising and glaciers are shrinking; record high temperatures and severe rainstorms and droughts are becoming increasingly common. Changes in temperatures and rainfall patterns alter plant and animal behavior and have significant implications for humans. In this section, explore the connections between the climate data and the changes happening around you—and those you can expect to see in the future—in all parts of the globe, including your own backyard.</p>

              <p>Not only are global warming-induced changes currently underway, but scientists also expect additional effects on human society and natural environments around the world. Some further warming is already unavoidable due to past heat-trapping emissions; unless we aggressively reduce today's emissions, scientists project extra warming and thus additional impacts.
              </p>

              The Climate Hot Map arranges current and future climate impacts into five main groupings:
              <ul>
              	<li>People</li>
              	<li>Freshwater</li>
              	<li>Oceans</li>
              	<li>Ecosystems</li>
              	<li>Temperature</li>
              </ul>
              Each of these major groupings, in turn, is divided into specific categories that describe more fully some of the consequences we may face. Click on any of the categories listed on the left for more information.
